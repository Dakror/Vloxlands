Vloxlands
=========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Dakror/Vloxlands.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Dakror/Vloxlands)

A 3D Voxel-based RTS Game on flying Islands.<br>
The Crystals keeping the islands floating, are your needed resources to expand your civilisation.

This is my second attempt on the concept.<br>
If you want to check out the first one, look here: [Ichmed/Vloxlands](https://github.com/Ichmed/Vloxlands).

Branches: `master` is always stable, while nightlies can be built from the `develop` branch.
