Vloxlands
=========

A 3D Voxel-based RTS Game on flying Islands.<br>

This is my second attempt on the concept.<br>
If you want to check out the first one, look here: [Ichmed/Vloxlands](https://github.com/Ichmed/Vloxlands).

`Master` is always stable, while nightlies can be built from the `develop` branch.
